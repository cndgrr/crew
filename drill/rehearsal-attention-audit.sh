# Sourceable helpers for the triage-role attention-AUDIT leg (#441). The live
# leg runs only from rehearsal.sh's authenticated triage block; every predicate
# stays here so CI can mutate its inputs — the invocation's report, the alert
# capture, the board reads — without a drill host.
#
# What this covers that nothing in drill/ read before (#441). #303 shipped
# `duty_attention_audit`, the triage-only hygiene slot's board audit, and no
# leg reads any of its three behaviours:
#
#   1. it reports BOTH malformed shapes — `attention` on a pull request, and
#      `attention` on an unassigned issue — through report_suppressed;
#   2. it never REPAIRS: the flags stay up, the issue stays unassigned, and no
#      comment is posted. The module's own comment forbids repair, and an audit
#      that quietly started moving labels would be the worse thing;
#   3. it alerts on TRANSITION only — 🚨 when the malformed set becomes
#      non-empty, ✅ when it clears, silence in between (#59).
#
# The audit exists because of a real incident: a ruling's `attention` went on a
# pull request instead of on the assigned claim it belonged to, and the wake's
# `filter=assigned` query could never return it. Both fixtures below are
# invisible to that query for exactly the same reason, which is precisely why
# they are the fixtures: neither can wake a session, so the leg cannot be green
# by accident on a board the wake was quietly clearing behind it.
#
# Why the leg calls duty_attention_audit directly (§1). The slot is hourly and
# self-scheduling; waiting for HYGIENE_INTERVAL would spend an hour of wall
# clock to re-prove scheduling, which is not this leg's subject. The behaviour
# is. So the leg sources common.sh, load_conf, sources the module and calls the
# function — the shape rehearsal-hygiene.sh already uses for _wt_release.
#
# Why the report is read off the invocation's own stdout rather than out of
# ~/duty/duty.log. They are the same bytes: log() prints to stdout and duty.sh
# is what redirects a tick into duty.log. Reading the shared file instead would
# have to diff it across a window a cron tick can write into, so a concurrent
# tick's lines would arrive inside this leg's "delta" — a report assertion that
# can pass on somebody else's report. The invocation's stdout cannot.

# --- box and board reads ---------------------------------------------------

# THE COLLISION THIS DEFERS, stated because it is the leg's one real race.
# duty.sh's hygiene slot calls duty_attention_audit itself, and that call
# shares ONE state file with this leg's: $DUTY_DIR/.attention-malformed. A
# cron tick landing between call 2 and call 3 would write the malformed set
# first, and this leg's own 🚨 would then be correctly suppressed — a red on a
# working engine, in the row whose whole subject is suppression.
#
# So the leg stamps the slot's clock forward for its own duration and restores
# it afterwards. That is scheduling, which §1 puts outside this leg's subject
# in both directions: the leg does not wait for the interval, and it does not
# leave the interval moved. Nothing on the box is edited — .hygiene-last is
# runtime state duty.sh writes on every hygiene run — and the restore is proved
# by re-reading it, not asserted.
#
# "Does not leave the interval moved" includes the rounds this leg never
# finishes. The saved value lives in the registry above and is handed back from
# rehearsal_attention_audit_cleanup, so rehearsal.sh's INT/TERM path unwinds it
# through the same door it removes the fixtures through — see
