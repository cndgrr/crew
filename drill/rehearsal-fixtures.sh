# Sourceable fixture and invariant helpers for drill/rehearsal.sh. These stay
# separate so their failure cases can be exercised without credentials or a
# host-side drill box.

# --- the board vocabulary, read off the box (#735) ----------------------------
#
# Every LABEL_* is operator-configurable. load_fleet_conf sources
# fleet.defaults.conf, then fleet.conf OVER it, and restores exactly six values
# afterwards — the MARK_* wire protocol (shared/lib/common/conf.sh:13-25). Not
# one LABEL_* is in that set, so an operator file genuinely moves every name in
# shared/conf/fleet.defaults.conf, and the engine then reads the moved one:
# duty_attention fetches `labels=$LABEL_ATTENTION` (duty-attention.sh:115) and
# the triage module grades the queue on the six queue names (duty-triage.sh).
#
# So the drill has to mint and match the same names. A fixture minted with the
# shipped English `attention` on a box that moved it is a demand the engine
# never fetches: the phase-2 wake spends its 900 seconds and reds on a correct
# engine. Same read, same shape as the attention census's own
# (rehearsal-safety.sh:483-518) — defaults, then fleet.conf over them, in ONE
# call per box.
#
# MARK_* is deliberately NOT read here. The marks are a wire protocol the
# loader restores over any operator file, and rehearsal_attention_census_take
# and rehearsal_load_installed_answer_mark below read them from the defaults
# ALONE for that reason. Resolving a mark through fleet.conf would key an
# assertion on a mark the engine never writes with.

#
# `grep -qxF` over the newline-separated SET, and never an `-E` pattern joined
# out of it. A label name is operator DATA: joined with `|` and read as an ERE,
# `LABEL_READY="ready.v2"` accepts an issue carrying the different label
# `readyXv2`, because `.` is a wildcard — the predicate then reports a board it
# never matched, which is this issue's own defect pointed the other way. A name
# carrying `|` is worse: it re-partitions the alternation and each fragment
# becomes a queue name the board does not have. `-F` takes each line as a fixed
# string and `-x` anchors it whole, so the comparison is the one D1 asks for.
#
# And `--` before it, because the SET is still an OPERAND, and an operand is the
# third place a resolved name stops being data. A name beginning with `-` sorts
# to the front of the set, so the operand begins with a hyphen and grep reads it
# as an option bundle. Which of two failures follows depends only on the
# letters: `LABEL_READY="-alert"` parses as `-a -l -e`, and `-e` then takes the
# REST of the operand — newlines and all — as its pattern argument, so the
# patterns compared are `rt`, `blocked`, `claimed`… The issue carrying the exact
# `-alert` reads STRAY and one carrying the fragment `rt` reads RULED, silently,
# on a board that has neither. `LABEL_READY="-active"` reaches `-t`, which is no
# option at all, and grep exits 2 with a usage message: every issue reads stray.
# The loader cannot catch either — both names are non-empty and whitespace-free,
# so both are names it must accept. `--` ends the option list and the set goes
# back to being the operand it always was.
#
# A here-string and not a pipe into `grep -q`: `grep -q` exits on its first
# match and the producer takes SIGPIPE, which under `set -o pipefail` makes the
# whole command red at random (#449). The guard in shared/test/common.sh reds on
# the shape itself.
#
# `queue_names`, not `names`. shellcheck resolves a sourced file's locals into
# the sourcing file's namespace, and `names` there turns shared/test/common.sh's
# own `r1=names-arrival-tick` into an arithmetic suggestion (SC2100) in a line

# --- phase-2's own fixtures, and the predicates that read them back -----------
#
# Sourceable for this file's stated reason: the three mints below and the three
# predicates that grade them are the sites #735 moved off the shipped English
# names, and a mint that asks for one name while its predicate matches another
# cannot be caught by reading either half. Each pair is driven against a stub
# board in shared/test/drill.sh instead. Every one prints its issue number on
# stdout or matches on the box's own effective name; none of them spells a
# board label.
#
# THE NAME NEVER REACHES jq AS SOURCE TEXT. A resolved name is operator data,
# so the two label predicates below fetch the issue JSON and pass it through
# `jq -e --arg`, the shape rehearsal_attention_is_ready_from_json already uses
# (rehearsal-attention.sh:139-142). Interpolated into the filter instead,
# LABEL_ATTENTION='needs"human' ends the string literal and the filter does not
# compile — so the predicate returns 1 on a CORRECT board and reds the round on
# a correct engine — and a backslash-bearing name mis-grades silently.
#
# That is also why neither reads a boolean back through `gh api --jq`, which
# MARSHALS it: a filter yielding null prints NOTHING where real jq prints
# "null", so the old `grep -qx true` idiom existed to put a token on stdout in
# both states. `jq -e` carries the answer in its exit status instead, and the
# marshalling cannot reach it. The `--jq` reads that remain here yield strings.
