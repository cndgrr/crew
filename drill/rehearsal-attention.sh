# Sourceable attention-wake drill helpers. The live leg runs only from
# rehearsal.sh's authenticated builder block; every predicate stays here so CI
# can mutate its inputs — the board reads, the session output, the box paths —
# without a drill host.
#
# What this covers that the two wake rows above it do not (#440). The
# role-independent wake rows assert the ACK: a pickup comment appears and the
# label comes off. Both were true before #301 and after it, so neither reads
# what #301 shipped:
#
#   1. dispatch without code — a builder attention wake on a claim with no open
#      PR and no build branch records the next build step, unassigns itself and
#      swaps claimed to ready, WITHOUT creating a branch, commit or PR
#      (shared/lib/duty-attention.sh, the builder route);
#   2. the timed-out pickup report — a session that exceeds TIMEOUT_ATTENTION
#      leaves one ⏱️ comment naming a STABLE log link, plants that link beside
#      the immutable run log, and fires the operator alert on the run log.
#
# The wake fixture's own demand forbids opening PRs, so the round could not
# tell a session that dispatched correctly from one that merely obeyed a
# prompt. This leg files its own fixture, whose demand ASKS for build work.
#
# Why the leg calls duty_attention directly instead of ticking. duty.sh runs
# duty_attention first and duty_builder second, and a correct dispatch is
# precisely an invitation to duty_builder: the same tick that dispatches may
# legitimately claim and build the issue it released. Asserting the absence of
# a PR after a whole tick would therefore red on correct behaviour. Calling the
# module directly — the shape rehearsal-hygiene.sh already uses for _wt_release
# — puts the assertion on what the attention session left behind, which is
# what #301 D1 is about.
